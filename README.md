## ChallengeWK3

## Be competent automating Jenkins 

### What was the challenge? 

- The challenge was to automate Jenkins to carry out triggered tasks. In this case the task was to set up Jenkins pipelines that take an app and its dependencies from a given git repo,  make the necessary builds, carry out given tests, create images in Docker and push these images to nexus upon being triggered by a push to the repository.

### How I expected the challenge to go. 

- I felt the challenge would be straightforward, it felt the various components we had been shown in isolation could be brought together in this challenge especially as we had access to the relevant demos.

### What went well? 

- Creating the Jenkinsfile and the scripts was straightforward as was getting the app.py to function manually in the terminal. I was able to get tne message "Hello friend. I'm currently running in $None." at port 5001 in the browser. 

### What didn't go as planned? 

- Jenkins was set to automated builds which failed each time. I was not able to rectify this within the deadline even though manually getting it running worked flawlessly

### Possible improvements for future challenges. .

- In future it may be helpful to get help to make sure Jenkins had been confiigured correctly for automated actions
